Usage / Terms of agreement

The branding of the mission is to stay ‘Altis Life RPG’. This means you cannot modify it to say something else. i.e Atlis Life by YOURCOMMUNITYNAME/TAG. Everything about the naming / branding is to be left untouched.

Naturally all credit is to remain intact on all files. Author cannot be modified via Description.ext but can be extended in briefing.sqf

All of my code is not to be used outside of the mission in another ‘Life’ like mission. It is to stay the Altis Life RPG Framework / my framework or you don’t use it and direct branding.

Some of my code can be used outside of the mission / framework but permission is to be asked first, if no response is received then it is a automatic NO.

Core configuration is allowed to be modified (i.e Prices and expansion of items / features).

Altis-Life RPG Framework is only allowed to be used with the Arma 3 vanilla maps with no extensions or mods (with the exception of server sided mods, and direct permission from author).

All edits made inside the framework is fine as long as it stays in the vanilla maps that Bohemia Interactive has released, past, present and future.

Features added by you to the mission are to stay to your modification in your server, distribution is not allowed without my permission, if you would like your feature to be added to the Altis Life RPG main distribution (by me) you can submit your changes and will be fully credited.

This is not be used commercially and is to remain freeware, this includes requiring donations / payment to be able to ‘play’ in your server with this mission. Playability of it is to remain free and open.

The additional content used within the framework either has the expressed permission of the content creators permission or was automatically used under the GPU (General Purpose License) from public posting with no usage / TOA / Disclaimer, however they still own the rights to their content. If in any case that content is being used within this mission / framework that the content creator doesn’t wish for it to be used due to my strict TOA / Agreement all you need to do is ask for it to be removed and it will be honored.

#My Modifications - waski35

Mission modified to some extent by Me, based on Altis Life RPG 3.4.8 by Tonic. It also contains code from "Economy System" and police textures taken from Altis Life RPG Official Forums, placed in its respective threads from their original Authors, in January 2015. As far as I remember Authors of this pieces of code allowed to use their code with Altis Life RPG, and for its modification process.
After over half of year, I don't remember names / nicknames of these authors, but to document their work, I'll post here information about their contribution, later today. I believe they agreed to put their code to this mission.

It also contains tweaked prices based on input from small community of players of our server, some vehicles added, some changes to cop shop, and medic shop, to better distinguish ranks, also there is some logic I put to reserve slots and bind them to ranks in Arma III group system for police and medics.
I have added additional shops on map, and tweaked spawn points to suit my server's community needs. So there's to some extent also my Work included.
